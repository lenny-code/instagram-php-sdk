=================

A simple PHP wrapper class to bring all the fancy Instagram images into your application.

It's work in progress, so features might be missing.

Please tell me what you think about this little wrapper.


You'll need
-----------
- PHP & cURL available on your server
- A registered Instagram application. Simply head over to [instagram.com/developer](http://instagram.com/developer), sign in and register a new application.


Usage
-----
1) Download this wrapper class, the bootstrap and the index file.

2) Include it in any of your projects.

3) Extract CLIENT ID, CLIENT SECRET and REDIRECT URI from your newly registered Instagram application ([instagram.com/developer/clients/manage](http://instagram.com/developer/clients/manage/)).

4) Start bootstrap in a secured area in order to receive an access token just for your server application.

5) Use index as a normal integration of this class.
